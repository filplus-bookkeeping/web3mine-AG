### Background & Context
This is the bookkeeping repo for the web3mine AG allocator. web3mine AG is a Liechtenstein-based company that launched the [Ramo Network](https://www.ramo.io/) (ramo.io). Ramo is an open cloud network that anyone can contribute to or use. It aggregates hardware from a network indepedent providers into a single, unified resource pool managed by open protocols, including Filecoin.

The infrastructure aggregated via the Ramo network can support the full spectrum of Cloud computing and storage use cases. For instance, [Ramo Cloud Storage](https://use.ramo.computer/) is an S3-compatible cloud storage solution. Clients can interact with it using a simple command-line interface for managing buckets and objects. Ramo Cloud Stroage is ideal for archived data, such as data stored for legal or regulatory reasons or for disaster recovery with very infrequent access. The integrity of data stored is verified daily via blockchain-based proofs ([Filecoin's PoRep and PoSt](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/the-blockchain/proofs)) and data is typically retrievable within 12 hours. 

Explore the [Ramo documentation](https://docs.ramo.io/) to learn more about the capabilities and components of the Ramo network.

### Eligible Datacap Applications
The purpose of this allocator is to provide datacap to paying users of [Ramo Cloud Storage](https://docs.ramo.io/use-cloud-services/ramo-cloud-storage/getting-started). The details of this allocator pathway were initially described in [application 1067](https://github.com/filecoin-project/notary-governance/issues/1067).

The datacap distributed via the web3mine allocator will be open to all clients who are paying to store data with storage providers that are supported by web3mine's Ramo Network. Anyone can provide storage on the Ramo Network by downloading and running [Ramo Computer](https://www.ramo.computer/) to begin monetizing their equipment. 

The ease of using Ramo Computer lowers the barrier to entry which enables a broader range of storage providers to compete and ultimately reduce costs for users of Ramo Cloud services. In addition, the decentralized nature of the network ensures resilience and avoids vendor lock-in.

### Datacap Abuse Prevention
The Filecoin Plus program defines quality data as all content that meets local regulatory requirements and that the data owner wants to see on the network, including private/encrypted data. To verify that somebody wants to store data, web3mine AG requires clients to pay for storage capacity. Information about specific datacap allocations will remain private since it may reveal information about pricing, client details and location that Ramo Cloud Storage users prefer to keep private.

web3mine AG keeps records (e.g., purchase receipts and similar) of Ramo Cloud Storage deals, including (where possible) a list of storage clients a client might resell their storage capacity to. These records may be made available to people signing non-disclosure agreements. Please contact us for more information. web3mine AG also commits to publishing high level summaries about Ramo Cloud Storage revenue backed by 3rd party payment provider (e.g., Stripe) receipts. Finally, web3mine AG encourages the community to purchase storage capacity from us to test the proper functioning of the service.

### Using Ramo Cloud Storage
To get started with Ramo Cloud Storage, begin by selecting a provider that aligns with your specific needs, including factors like location, cost, and other preferences. If you have no specific preferences, visit [use.ramo.computer](https://use.ramo.computer/) to get started. You can also purchase a bucket at [use.ramo.io](https://use.ramo.io/).

In line with other cloud storage solutions, Ramo Cloud Storage providers typically charge your based on the volume and duration (e.g., USD/TB-month) for which you want to store your data and the volume of data you would like to retrieve (e.g., USD/TB) and transfer (e.g., USD/TB). 

Once you have selected your storage provider(s), download the Ramo Cloud Storage app (ramo-cli), a simple command-line interface for managing buckets and storage on the storage infrastructure of your provider(s) using the [Ramo S3 API](https://docs.ramo.io/use-cloud-services/ramo-cloud-storage/using-ramo-api).
