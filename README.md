### Background & Context
This is the bookkeeping repo for the web3mine AG allocator. web3mine AG is a Liechtenstein-based company that launched the [Ramo Network](https://www.ramo.io/) (ramo.io). Ramo is an open cloud network that anyone can contribute to or use. It aggregates hardware from a network indepedent providers into a single, unified resource pool managed by open protocols, including Filecoin.

The infrastructure aggregated via the Ramo network can support the full spectrum of Cloud computing and storage use cases. For instance, [Ramo Cloud Storage](https://use.ramo.computer/) is an S3-compatible cloud storage solution. Clients can interact with it using a simple command-line interface for managing buckets and objects. Ramo Cloud Stroage is ideal for archived data, such as data stored for legal or regulatory reasons or for disaster recovery with very infrequent access. The integrity of data stored is verified daily via blockchain-based proofs ([Filecoin's PoRep and PoSt](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/the-blockchain/proofs)) and data is typically retrievable within 12 hours. 

Explore the [Ramo documentation](https://docs.ramo.io/) to learn more about the capabilities and components of the Ramo network.

### Eligible Datacap Applications
This purpose of this allocator is to provide datacap to paying users of [Ramo Cloud Storage](https://docs.ramo.io/use-cloud-services/ramo-cloud-storage/getting-started). The details of this allocator pathway were initially described in [application 1067](https://github.com/filecoin-project/notary-governance/issues/1067).

The datacap distributed via the web3mine allocator will be open to all clients who are paying to store data with storage providers that are supported by web3mine's Ramo Network. Anyone can provide storage on the Ramo Network by downloading and running [Ramo Computer](https://www.ramo.computer/) to begin monetizing their equipment. To store data with Ramo Network visit 

The ease of using Ramo Computer lowers the barrier to entry which enables a broader range of storage providers to compete and ultimately reduce costs for users of Ramo Cloud services. In addition, the decentralized nature of the network ensures resilience and avoids vendor lock-in.

### Using Ramo Cloud Storage
To get started with Ramo Cloud Storage, begin by selecting a provider that aligns with your specific needs, including factors like location, cost, and other preferences. If you have no specific preferences, visit [use.ramo.computer](https://use.ramo.computer/) to get started. You can also purchase a bucket at [use.ramo.io](https://use.ramo.io/).

In line with other cloud storage solutions, Ramo Cloud Storage providers typically charge your based on the volume and duration (e.g., USD/TB-month) for which you want to store your data and the volume of data you would like to retrieve (e.g., USD/TB) and transfer (e.g., USD/TB). 

Use this [cost calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5Sdi6t3Gh4lzpLvrIO4_dE1-izNcorSQtPotrNwSKE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to create initial costs estimates for your storage needs. Note that different Ramo Cloud Storage providers may offer different pricing options and features. Typically, prices are a fraction of what conventional providers charge for similar cloud storage services.

Once you have selected your storage provider(s), download the Ramo Cloud Storage app (ramo-cli), a simple command-line interface for managing buckets and storage on the storage infrastructure of your provider(s) using the [Ramo S3 API](https://docs.ramo.io/use-cloud-services/ramo-cloud-storage/using-ramo-api).
